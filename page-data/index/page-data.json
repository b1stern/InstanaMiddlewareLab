Each section of the lab is intended to be independent and \ncan be executed in any order.  The lab exercises include:\n- Provision a virtual machine into the IBM public cloud using the service library.  \n    In this section, you'll learn how to provision a VM, publish a service to the service library, and modify a service to add additional capabilties.\n    One of the key capabilities is how the \"manage services\" allow you to combine tools like Terraform and Ansible Tower to achieve more complex automations.\n    Complex workflows can be achieved via the Composition page and you'll learn how to use the drag and drop capabilities.\n- Provision a virtual machine into a VMware environment using the service library.\n    In this section, you'll learn how Terraform is leveraged to provision the virtual machine to the public cloud and how parameters are defined and \n    exposed in the service. You'll also see how tags can be defined in the virtual machines and used for other activities such as chargeback reports.\n- Use Infrastructure Management view detailed information about your containerized environments and setup chargeback reports\n\nAfter completing the Login section, use the other links to go directly to one of the lab exercises.\n\n<Row>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Automation with the Public Cloud\"\n    title=\"Want to learn how to automate infrastructure management in Public clouds?\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/ibmcloud\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/public-cloud.jpg)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"white\"\n    subTitle=\"Automation with VMware\"\n    title=\"Want to learn how to automate infrastructure management in VMWare vSphere?\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/vmware\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/multi-cloud.jpg)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Managing chargeback\"\n    title=\"Do you want to create and execute a chargeback report on the VM and container workloads?\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/costmgmt\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/prereqs.jpg)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>\n<ArticleCard\n    color=\"dark\"\n    subTitle=\"Managing SRE console access\"\n    title=\"Do you want to learn how to provide SRE secure terminal access to Virtual Machines?\"\n    href=\"/tutorials/Console_Access\"\n    actionIcon=\"arrowRight\"\n    >\n\n![](images/secure-access.jpg)\n\n</ArticleCard>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n***\n\n## Logging into the Environment\n\n  Before beginning the exercises, take the following steps to login to the soleil environment and access the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management console.\n\n  After opening your browser and logging into the lab, you'll see an image of a remote computer.  This is your virtual machine.\n\n  ![](images/2021-04-27-19-54-51.png)\n\n  If the background is green, it means the virtual machine is running.  If it is not running, click the start arrow to start the VM\n  ![](images/2021-04-27-20-00-11.png)\n\n  After the VM is running, click the picture of the computer to launch the desktop.\n\n  For more information on using the soleil environment, click the link below.\n\n## Using the soleil environment\n\n  Within the desktop, you'll see both Firefox and Chrome browsers.  You will be using the browser to access the user interface\n  to perform the automation exercises.  \n  ![](images/2021-04-27-20-17-09.png)\n  - Launch the browser of your choice\n\n  - Within the browser interface, you will find the primary Think Lab 2176 and backup Think Lab 20176 bookmarks. Unless instructed otherwise, use the \"primary\" environment.  The backup environment is only there if there are problems with the primary environment.\n  - Select the link to launch the primary lab environment\n  - The first time you login, you may be prompted to select a login type.  Select the \"Enterprise LDAP\" login type as seen below\n\n    ![](images/2021-04-27-20-46-38.png)\n\n    Note:  The solution supports multipe types of login credentials. This environment is setup with an enterprise LDAP server.\n\n  - The initial screen will be the login panel.  Within your desktop, a username will be assigned to you.  The usernames and passwords\n    are as follows:\n\n      student1/waiops-private1\n      student2/waiops-private2\n      …\n      student30/waiops-private30\n\n  - It is important, that you login with your assigned username and password to avoid conflicts with other students.\n  - Enter your userid and password and click the \"Log in\" icon\n\n    ![](images/2021-04-27-20-48-36.png)\n\n  - Depending on your previous navigation, occasionally, you will be taken to this screen.\n\n    ![](images/2021-04-27-20-53-29.png)\n\n    If this happens, click the \"Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management\" URL\n  - You are now on the home page and can begin the exercises.  As you move from one lab exercise to another, they all begin from this starting page.  If you lose your place within the browser, you can always use the bookmark within your browser.\n    \n    ![](images/2021-04-28-10-41-10.png)\n\n  Next, scroll up, select one of the lab exercises and begin learning to use the Automation capabilities.\n\n***\n\n## Using the soleil environment\n\n  There are a couple of things that are important to know when using the soleil environment.  At the top of the screen you will see a menu bar.  You'll notice a full screen icon as shown below. You'll have a much better experience with the lab if you use full screen.\n\n  ![](images/2021-04-27-20-24-32.png)\n\n  Another icon on the taskbar that is important is the clipboard icon\n\n  ![](images/2021-04-28-10-47-13.png)\n\n  The only way to paste content into the virtual machine is by using this icon.\n\n  To copy text into the virtual machine, perform a copy as you normally would do on your laptop/desktop.  Then, click the clipboard icon. You will notice that there is text within the clipboard user interface\n\n  ![](images/2021-04-27-20-40-37.png)\n\n  This will make the text available within the virtual machine. Then, within the virtual machine, either type \"Ctrl-V\" or right-click and use your browser to paste the text into the virtual machine.\n\n  To copy text from the virtual machine, do the process in reverse.  Copy the text inside the virtual machine.  Then, click the clipboard icon and you will notice that the text is visible on the screen.\n\n  ![](images/2021-04-27-20-40-37.png)\n\n  Whatever text you see on the VM clipboard, you'll be able to past within your laptop/desktop.\n\n  Note:  The clipboard is a little bit unreliable.  You may need to attempt to copy/paste a couple of timess.  Also, try to avoid clicking in multiple places on the screen. Copy the content (Ctrl-C), click on the clipboard, then immediately paste to either your laptop or into the virtual machine.","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"2c27fa011c6a98700e02a1431a8f4236","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":246},"frontmatter":{"title":"Think Lab 2176","description":"Automate with confidence using Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"--- \ntitle: Think Lab 2176\ndescription: Automate with confidence using Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis lab will focus on leveraging the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management and the \nCloud Pak for Watson AIOps to improve your efficiency by automating some of the tasks \nthat your organization may be executing manually.\n\nThe lab consists of a few different exercises that will allow you to understand the \ncapabilities to automate key tasks.
